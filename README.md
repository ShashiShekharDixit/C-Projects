## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShashiShekharDixit/C-Projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cpp-projects
   ```

3. Compile the project with a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ project-name.cpp -o project-name
   ```

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   ./project-name
   ```

## Authentication (If Applicable)

Some projects may require simple authentication mechanisms, like verifying user credentials before allowing access to features. This can be implemented using basic login systems with usernames and passwords.

---

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
